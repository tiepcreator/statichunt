Statichunt is an open-source directory that enlists hundreds of themes, starters, and resources for static site generators submitted by the community.

## The Journey Towards Statichunt

I’ve purchased the [statichunt.com](https://statichunt.com/) domain back in 2018 to create something for the static ecosystem. At that time, I wasn’t sure about what I wanted to build. But the domain was being maintained which soon became ideal.

Parallelly I started working with Hugo (a popular static site generator) and established a brand called [gethugothemes](https://gethugothemes.com/). Gradually the site marched the roadmap with success because it stood out in the Hugo industry in a positive way. Also, my concern was to make the community aware of the significance of the brand.

Soon I discovered a directory named[ jamstacthemes.dev ](https://jamstackthemes.dev/)where users can publish and distribute their static themes. It's an amazing site where they’ve assembled an outstanding assortment of themes, templates, and starters for static site generators.

I’ve personally reached the author of Jamstackthemes - Rob Austin, a very cooperative person. All I wanted is to contribute some unique thoughts to the platform. Unfortunately, he was really busy at that time. However, based on our short conversation, he did not appear to have any grand plans to take the site to the next level.

Suddenly, an idea clicked on my mind: why not fork that site (as[ jamstackthemes.dev](https://jamstackthemes.dev/) site was released under MIT license) and create a better version of it. Since my team already has previous experience in working with static site generators.

I talked with our team members and brainstormed how to make a good enhancement in that solution. As a result, we came up with a few ideas, some redesigns, and theme filtering. Also, we wanted to add resources so that developers and community members can get everything related to static site generators in one spot.

Lastly, after two months of the tireless effort of our team, a better version of the original codebase emerged. Therefore, we upgraded the UX, screened out the outdated themes, and added more high-quality themes. Finally, the beta version of Statichunt was released.

Why create a similar solution when a pioneer is available in the market? Our observation was clear and simple - Static themes, starters, and resources were never stacked in a single platform. Our core concern was to collaborate. Therefore, we reimagined the platform and consolidated all the quality resources.

The constant effort of my team was eventually blooming. In Statichunt, all the themes & resources were gathered by ensuring the quality. Developers are now creating their SSG projects with ease. Consequently, community members and users are eagerly contributing to this platform. Currently, my vision is to broaden the contribution to such an extent that people can learn and generate ideas via Statichunt.
