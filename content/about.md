Statichunt is a free open source directory that lists hundreds of JAMstack themes, starters, and resources for JAMstack sites.


## What is the motivation?

The popularity of Jamstack is consistently growing not only among business owners or marketers but also among developers.
Today Jamstack allows developers to rely on a static websiteâ€™s advantages including better web performance and security benefits.

We discovered that developers are regularly looking for high-quality themes, starters, and resources for their Jamstack project. There are hundreds of free themes and resources out there for Jamstack sites but we were surprised there was no high-quality resource that collected all of them in one place! So we decided to create one so that the developers can find any kind of resources they need for their Jamstack project & make their life easy.
